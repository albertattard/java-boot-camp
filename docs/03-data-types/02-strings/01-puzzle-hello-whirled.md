# Puzzle (Hello Whirled)

```java
/**

package demo;

public class App {
  public static void main( final String[] args ) {
    System.out.print( "Hell" );
    System.out.println( "o world" );
  }
}
```

What do you think the above will print, if you get it to compile!!

This example was taken from [PUZZLE 15: HELLO WHIRLED in Javaâ„¢ Puzzlers: Traps, Pitfalls, and Corner Cases](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/javatm-puzzlers-traps/032133678X/ch03.html).

"_The problem is in the third line of the comment, which contains the characters `\units`.  These characters begin with a backslash (`\`) followed by the letter `u`, which denotes the start of a Unicode escape.  Unfortunately, these characters are not followed by four hexadecimal digits, so the Unicode escape is ill-formed, and the compiler is required to reject the program.  Unicode escapes must be well formed, even if they appear in comments._"
