# Java Light

The purpose of this section is to introduce some common aspects of the Java programming language **without delving into any depths**.  When discussing any topic in some detail we may need to also touch other topics that have not yet been mentioned.  For example, loops and collections go together and either way you start, one needs to come before the other.  This section acts as an introduction, hopefully simplifying the digesting the rest of the boot camp.  Do not worry if some of the concepts do not sink in as each item is discussed in depth later on.
