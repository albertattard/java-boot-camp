# Collections

A collection is a data structure which contains a set of data.  The data stored in the collection is encapsulated and the access to the data is only possible via predefined methods.  Typical collections are: lists, sets, maps, queues, stacks, and trees.  Java provides an interface for each collection type and one or several implementations for this interface.
