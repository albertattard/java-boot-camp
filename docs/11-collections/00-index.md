# Collections

A collection is a data structure which contains a set of data.  The data stored in the collection is encapsulated and the access to the data is only possible via predefined methods.  Typical collections are _lists_, _sets_, _maps_, _queues_, _stacks_, and _trees_.  Java provides an interface for each collection type and one or several implementations for this interface.
