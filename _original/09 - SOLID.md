## Setup

## Single-responsibility Principle

A student can enrol in several classes and a grade is calculated at the end of the semester based on the student grades.  The school also provides recommendations.  All student logic is captured by one class.

```java
package demo;

import java.util.List;

public class Student {

  private List<Enrollment> enrollments;
  private List<Course> studentBrowsingHistory;
  private List<Course> schoolBrowsingHistory;

  public Recommendations findRecommendations() { }

  public Grade calculateGrade() { }
}
```

The `calculateGrade()` is used by the *Enrollment Management* department while the `findRecommendations()` is used by the *Academic Advising* department.

Say that a change requested by *Academic Advising* department introduces a bug
