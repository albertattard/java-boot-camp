## Java

### What is Java?

Java is a general-purpose programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

Java is fast, secure, and reliable.  From smartcards to datacentres, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!

Java is an overloaded term.  Sometimes the term Java is used to refer to the programming language while other times it is used to refer to the Java Virtual Machine.

1. The Java Programming Language
1. The Java Language Specification
1. The Java Standard Library
1. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
1. The Java Virtual Machine Specification
1. The Java Development Kit (JDK)
1. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) sometimes also referred to as Platform
1. The Java Standard Edition (JSE)
1. The Java Micro Edition (JME)
1. The Java Enterprise Environment (JEE)

### How do we develop Java Applications?

An application running on the Java platform starts from source code written in one of the JVM languages as shown next.

![Java from Development to Runtime](assets/images/Java%20from%20Development%20to%20Runtime.png)

The source code is compiled into Bytecode.  Bytecode is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by the Java JIT compiler.  Each Bytecode is composed of one byte that represents the [opcode](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-7.html), along with zero or more bytes for operands.  Of the 256 possible byte-long `opcodes`, 202 are currently in use.

**The Bytecode is machine independent and it does not matter on which OS the Bytecode is generated**.  The source code can be compiled into Bytecode on a Windows machine and then used on a Mac or vice versa.  The JIT takes the Bytecode and then convert this into machine dependent code.

It is important to note that to develop and compile Java source code you need to have a JDK installed.  To run a Java application (including all programming languages that run on the JVM) you need to have the JRE installed.  Note that a JDK also includes the JRE and no need to install a separate JRE when you have a JDK installed.

### Java Language Specification

The [Java Language Specification (JLS)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/index.html) is the definitive technical reference for the Java programming language.  Anything related to the Java programming language and its behaviour is documented in the Java language specification.

The specification is the authority on language behaviour, but it is terse and not user-friendly.  If you are ever in any doubt about the behaviour of Java code, the specification provides the definitive answer.

These specifications are not always easy to read and not meant as a beginner's tutorial.

#### 🤔 Given that the specification is hard to read and understand, why should I care?

With the understanding that this may be too technical and do not worry if you do not understand any of this.

Consider the following code fragment.

```java
int a = -7;
int b = +a;
```

The above code fragment shows the use of the `+` unary operator.  This operator is rarely used, and its behaviour is unknown to many.  The description provided by an official [Java tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op1.html) is:

"_Unary plus operator; indicates positive value (numbers are positive without this, however)_"

Many believe that the unary `+` operator is the opposite of the unary `-` operator, and the following should print `7`.

```java
int a = -7;
int b = +a;
System.out.println(b);
```

That is very misleading.  This operator's real functionality is explained in the [Java Language Specifications, section 15.15.3. Unary Plus Operator +](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.15.3).

"_Unary numeric promotion ([§5.6](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.6)) is performed on the operand. The type of the unary plus expression is the promoted type of the operand. The result of the unary plus expression is not a variable, but a value, even if the result of the operand expression is a variable._"

In other words, variables of types `byte`, `short` and `char` are promoted to type `int`.  The previous example will simply print `-7`.

## Setup Environment (SDKMAN)

SDKMAN is a command line tool that allows us to install different versions of Java, Gradle, Maven and more.  SDKMAN also takes care of setting environment variables for you. Installing SDKMAN.

1. Install

    ```bash
    $ curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
    $ source "~/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
    ```

1. Check version after installation

    ```bash
    $ sdk version
    SDKMAN 5.7.4+362
    ```

1. List all available Java versions

    ```bash
    $ sdk list java
    ```

    This will print all versions available to SDKMAN from different [vendors](https://sdkman.io/jdks).

    ```bash
    ================================================================================
    Available Java Versions
    ================================================================================
     Vendor        | Use | Version      | Dist    | Status     | Identifier
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     AdoptOpenJDK  |     | 14.0.1.j9    | adpt    |            | 14.0.1.j9-adpt
                   |     | 14.0.1.hs    | adpt    | installed  | 14.0.1.hs-adpt
                   |     | 13.0.2.j9    | adpt    |            | 13.0.2.j9-adpt
                   |     | 13.0.2.hs    | adpt    |            | 13.0.2.hs-adpt
                   |     | 12.0.2.j9    | adpt    |            | 12.0.2.j9-adpt
                   |     | 12.0.2.hs    | adpt    |            | 12.0.2.hs-adpt
                   |     | 11.0.7.j9    | adpt    |            | 11.0.7.j9-adpt
                   |     | 11.0.7.hs    | adpt    |            | 11.0.7.hs-adpt
                   |     | 11.0.6.hs    | adpt    | local only | 11.0.6.hs-adpt
                   |     | 8.0.252.j9   | adpt    |            | 8.0.252.j9-adpt
                   | >>> | 8.0.252.hs   | adpt    | installed  | 8.0.252.hs-adpt
    ...
    ```

    The above shows three versions of Java installed

    1. `14.0.1.hs-adpt`
    1. `11.0.6.hs-adpt`
    1. `8.0.252.hs-adpt`

    The version `11.0.6.hs-adpt` is not available anymore as there is a newer version available, the version `11.0.7.hs-adpt`. That's why it has the status of `local only`.

    The version `8.0.252.hs-adpt` is the current default version of Java.

1. Install the latest Java 11 and Java 14

    ```bash
    $ sdk install java 14.0.1.hs-adpt
    $ sdk install java 11.0.7.hs-adpt
    ```

    OpenJDK comes in two flavours:

    1. **HotSpot** (`...x.hs-adpt`) is the VM from the OpenJDK community. It is the most widely used VM today and is used in Oracle's JDK ([reference](https://openjdk.java.net/groups/hotspot/)).

    1. **Eclipse OpenJ9** (`...x.j9-adpt`) is the VM from the Eclipse community. It is an enterprise-grade VM designed for low memory footprint and fast start-up and is used in IBM's JDK ([reference](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/)).

1. Change the default Java

    ```bash
    $ sdk default java 14.0.1.hs-adpt
    Default java version set to 14.0.1.hs-adpt
    ```

    Verify the version

    ```bash
    $ java -version
    openjdk version "14.0.1" 2020-04-14
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 14.0.1+7)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 14.0.1+7, mixed mode, sharing)
    ```

    **Optionally**, add an alias to simplify switching from one version to another.

    ```bash
    $ vi ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/dev.zsh
    ```

    Add the aliases

    ```bash
    alias java11='sdk default java 11.0.7.hs-adpt'
    alias java14='sdk default java 14.0.1.hs-adpt'
    ```

    Note that the aliases will need to be updated when different versions of Java are added or removed.

    To switch between versions just use `java11` and `java14`.

    ```bash
    $ java14
    Default java version set to 14.0.1.hs-adpt
    ```

1. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable

    ```bash
    $ echo $JAVA_HOME
    ~/.sdkman/candidates/java/current
    ```

    If the environment variable is missing, it will be blank.  Edit the `~/.zshrc` to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

    ```bash
    $ vi ~/.zshrc
    ```

    Add the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable

    ```bash
    export JAVA_HOME="~/.sdkman/candidates/java/current"
    ```

    Open a new terminal and verify that this was properly set.

    ```bash
    $ ${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java -version
    openjdk version "14.0.1" 2020-04-14
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 14.0.1+7)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 14.0.1+7, mixed mode, sharing)
    ```

## Gradle and Maven

Gradle and Maven are *build automation tools* that are designed to be flexible enough to build almost any type of software, ranging from mobile application to web applications and command line applications.

1. Gradle ([https://gradle.org/](https://gradle.org/))
1. Maven ([http://maven.apache.org/](http://maven.apache.org/))

According to [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=maven,gradle), Maven is the most popular build tool.

![Popularity](assets/images/Maven%20vs.%20Gradle.png)

### Advantages of Gradle over Maven

1. **Flexible**

    Changing the build lifecycle using Maven is harder than expected.  Gradle addressed this and made it easy to customise the lifecycles as required ([reference](https://gradle.org/maven-vs-gradle/)).

1. **Performant**

    ![Performance](https://gradle.org/images/performance/maven-vs-gradle.gif)
    ([Reference](https://gradle.org/gradle-vs-maven-performance/))

1. **Better Dependency Management**

   Maven allows one to override a dependency, but only by their version. Gradle provides customizable dependency selection and substitution rules that can be declared once and handle unwanted dependencies project-wide.  This substitution mechanism enables Gradle to build multiple source projects together to create composite builds ([reference](https://gradle.org/maven-vs-gradle/)).

### Install Gradle

1. Install

    Either using `SDKMAN`

    ```bash
    $ sdk install gradle 6.3
    ```

    or using `brew`

    ```bash
    $ brew install gradle
    ```

1. Verify

    ```bash
    $ gradle -version

## Create a project using Gradle

### Create Project

1. Create a directory

    ```bash
    $ mkdir demo
    ```

    Navigate inside the directory

    ```bash
    $ cd demo
    ```

    **All command will be executed from within the `demo` directory unless otherwise stated.**

1. Create the project

    The following command is using the version of Gradle that is available at the OS level.

    ```bash
    $ gradle init

### Explore Project

1.  Print the directory structure

    ```bash
    $ tree -a .
    ```

    Gradle created the following directory structure

    ```bash
    .
    ├── .gitattributes
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .gradle
    ... content of the .gradle directory removed for brevity
    ├── build.gradle
    ├── gradle
    │   └── wrapper
    │       ├── gradle-wrapper.jar
    │       └── gradle-wrapper.properties
    ├── gradlew
    ├── gradlew.bat
    ├── settings.gradle
    └── src
        ├── main
        │   ├── java
        │   │   └── demo
        │   │       └── App.java
        │   └── resources
        └── test
            ├── java
            │   └── demo
            │       └── AppTest.java
            └── resources
    ```

1. [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html)

    ```bash
    $ ls -l
    -rw-r--r-- .gitattributes
    -rw-r--r-- .gitignore
    drwxr-xr-x .gradle
    -rw-r--r-- build.gradle
    drwxr-xr-x gradle
    -rwxr-xr-x gradlew
    -rw-r--r-- gradlew.bat
    -rw-r--r-- settings.gradle
    drwxr-xr-x src
    ```

    A Gradle wrapper was included by the `gradle init` process as this is the preferred way to work ([reference](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html)).  Other developers do not require Gradle to be installed when working with the Gradle Wrapper.  Build Pipelines, such as [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) and [GoCD](https://www.gocd.org/), do not need to have Gradle installed as they can use the Gradle wrapper included with the project.

    ```bash
    drwxr-xr-x gradle
    -rwxr-xr-x gradlew
    -rw-r--r-- gradlew.bat
    ```

    Instead of using `gradle`, now we can use `./gradlew` (or `./gradlew.bat` on Windows).  As mentioned before, **when using the wrapper, we do not require to have Gradle installed**.

    **It is imperative to include the Gradle wrapper files and folder in the project repository**.

1. Open the project in IDE

    IntelliJ

    ```bash
    $ idea .
    ```

    VS Code

    ```bash
    $ code .
    ```

1. Open the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file

    ```properties
    distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
    distributionPath=wrapper/dists
    distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.3-bin.zip
    zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
    zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
    ```

    The list of releases is found at: [releases](https://gradle.org/releases/) page.

    We can configure Gradle's properties to be used by the project from this file, including the version of Gradle.  This ensures that everyone on the project make use of the same configuration (and version) of Gradle.

1. Open the `build.gradle` file

    Comments removed for brevity.

    ```groovy
    plugins {
      id 'java'
      id 'application'
    }

    repositories {
      jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
      implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:28.2-jre'
      testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.6.0'
      testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.6.0'
    }

    application {
      mainClassName = 'demo.App'
    }

    test {
      useJUnitPlatform()
    }
    ```

    [Plugins](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html) enable more Gradle features.  For example, the following plugin will enable [Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/gradle-plugin/reference/html/) Gradle tasks.

    ```groovy
    plugins {
      id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.2.6.RELEASE'
    }
    ```

    A list of plugins is available [here](https://plugins.gradle.org/).

    The [dependency](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html) section manages other libraries that our project uses.  For example, we can add new dependency, such as the [Apache Commons Lang3](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons-lang3/3.0) shown next by, adding the dependency.

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
      implementation group: 'org.apache.commons', name: 'commons-lang3', version: '3.0'
    }
    ```

    The dependencies can defined as a single line, delimited by a `:`

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
      implementation 'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.0'
    }
    ```

    Dependencies have [scopes](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#tab:configurations).  Dependencies that are only needed for tests, will have the `testImplementation` scope and are excluded from other scopes.  These two scopes are enabled by the [Java plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html).

    Dependencies of the same scope can be grouped together as shown next.

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
      implementation(
       'org.apache.commons:commons-lang3:3.0',
       'com.google.guava:guava:28.2-jre'
      )
    }
    ```

    Dependencies are fetched from [repositories](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html), defined in the `repositories` section.  We are using the [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) repository.

    ```groovy
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    ```

    The application and tests are configured in the following respective sections.

    ```groovy
    application {
        mainClassName = 'demo.App'
    }

    test {
        useJUnitPlatform()
    }
    ```

1. Run the project from the IDE

## Hello World Application (from source to executable application)

### Gradle Task Dependency Tree

1. Run the project

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew run

    > Task :run
    Hello world.
    ```

1. Adjust Logging Level

    The [run](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/command_line_interface.html#running_applications) tasks will also compile the code and perform all necessary things.  It performs three more tasks:

    1. [compileJava](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_tasks)
    1. [processResources](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_tasks)
    1. [classes](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_tasks)

    Using the `-i` (or `--info`) [logging option](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/logging.html#logging), Gradle will produce more information.

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew run -i
    ...
    > Configure project :
    Evaluating root project 'demo' using build file 'build.gradle'.
    All projects evaluated.
    Selected primary task 'run' from project :
    Tasks to be executed: [task ':compileJava', task ':processResources', task ':classes', task ':run']
    Tasks that were excluded: []
    :compileJava (Thread[Execution worker for ':',5,main]) started.
    ...
    ```

1. Display Task Dependency Tree

    Add the [task tree](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.dorongold.task-tree) plugin

    ```groovy
    plugins {
      id 'com.dorongold.task-tree' version '1.5'
    }
    ```

    Display the other tasks the `run` task depends on

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew run taskTree
    ```

    The result shows an inverted tree, where the top nodes depend on the lower nodes

    ```bash
    :run
    \--- :classes
         +--- :compileJava
         \--- :processResources
    ```

    The `run` task depends on the `classes` task which depends on two more tasks.

### Project Dependencies

Gradle tasks add functionality to Gradle.  Dependencies add functionality to the project.  Instead of re-inventing the wheel, we can leverage code developed by others and just focus on the task at hand.

1. List project dependencies

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew dep
    ```

    This is very useful to identify any conflicting dependencies

    ```bash
    > Task :dependencies

    ------------------------------------------------------------
    Root project
    ------------------------------------------------------------

    ...

### Package Project

1. Build the project

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew clean build
    ```

    This will produce a [JAR](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jarGuide.html) file at

    ```
    build/libs/demo.jar
    ```

    JAR is a simple ZIP file.  Unzip it.

    ```bash
    $ unzip build/libs/demo.jar -d temp
    Archive:  build/libs/demo.jar
      creating: temp/META-INF/
     inflating: temp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
      creating: temp/demo/
     inflating: temp/demo/App.class
    ```

    The `temp` directory contains two folders and each folder will contain one file.

    ```
    $ tree temp
    temp
    ├── META-INF
    │   └── MANIFEST.MF
    └── demo
        └── App.class

    2 directories, 2 files
    ```

    The `temp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file is a text file created by one of the Gradle tasks.

    ```bash
    $ cat temp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    ```

    The `demo/App.class` file is the compiled version (Bytecode) of the source file: `src/main/java/demo/App.java`.

    ![What does a modern JVM look like](assets/images/What%20does%20a%20modern%20JVM%20look%20like.png)
    Image copied from: [Theory: JVM Subsystems](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/optimizing-java/9781492044673/9781492044673-video323884)

    The Bytecode produced when compiling this class can be viewed using the `javap` command as shown next.

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew build
    $ javap -c build/classes/java/main/demo/App.class
    Compiled from "App.java"
    public class demo.App {
      public demo.App();
        Code:
           0: aload_0
           1: invokespecial #1                  // Method java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
           4: return

      public java.lang.String getGreeting();
        Code:
           0: ldc           #7                  // String Hello world.
           2: areturn

      public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
        Code:
           0: getstatic     #9                  // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
           3: new           #15                 // class demo/App
           6: dup
           7: invokespecial #17                 // Method "<init>":()V
          10: invokevirtual #18                 // Method getGreeting:()Ljava/lang/String;
          13: invokevirtual #22                 // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
          16: return
    }
    ```

    Alternatively, we can use the [IntelliJ Jclasslib plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9248-jclasslib-Bytecode-viewer).

    Click on `View > Show Bytecode with Jclasslib`

    ![Show Bytecode With Jclasslib](assets/images/Show%20Bytecode%20With%20Jclasslib.png)

    Expand `Methods > main > Code`

    ![Bytecode](assets/images/App%20Main%20Method%20Bytecode.png)

    The section [Internals: Bytecode Basics](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/optimizing-java/9781492044673/9781492044673-video323889), part of the [Optimizing Java O'Reilly Video Series](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/optimizing-java/9781492044673), covers this topic in some depth and is a recommended follow up.

1. Run the application

    ```bash
    $ java -jar build/libs/demo.jar
    no main manifest attribute, in build/libs/demo.jar
    ```

    This JAR is not yet an executable JAR.  The `MANIFEST.MF` is missing the `Main-Class` attribute.  Java does not know where to go and which class to execute.  Note that a project may contain hundreds if not thousands to classes.  Java will look into the `MANIFEST.MF` for the `Main-Class` attribute and will execute that.

1. Configure the `jar` task

    File: `build.gradle`

    ```groovy
    jar {
      manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': application.mainClassName
      }
    }
    ```

    Note that the above fragment is referring to another value defined elsewhere.

    Build the project

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew clean build
    ```

    Remove the `temp` directory and unzip it again

    ```bash
    $ rm -rf temp
    $ unzip build/libs/demo.jar -d temp
    ```

    The manifest now contains the `Main-Class` attribute.

    ```bash
    $ cat temp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
    Manifest-Version: 1.0
    Main-Class: demo.App
    ```

    Run the application.

    ```bash
    $ java -jar build/libs/demo.jar
    ```

    This time, it should work.

    ```bash
    Hello world.
    ```

## Extend your application capabilities (using third-party libraries)

It is not recommended to reinvent the wheel and in many cases a library already exists which does exactly what you need.

1. Import the third-party library (dependency)

    The application also contains the Guava dependency.

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
      implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:28.2-jre'
    }
    ```

    Classes that are part of this library (referred to as dependency as our project depends on this library) can now be used by our program.

1. Use the third-party library

    One of the most popular classes with the Guava library is the [`Preconditions` class](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/PreconditionsExplained).  This class contains useful methods that can be used to check parameters to make sure that these adhere to the method contract.  For example, a function may only accept positive numbers.  The `Preconditions` class has methods to validate such parameters.

    ```java
    package demo;

    import com.google.common.base.Preconditions;

    public class App {
      public String getGreeting() {
        return "Hello world.";
      }

      public static void main( String[] args ) {
        String greeting = Preconditions.checkNotNull( new App().getGreeting() );
        System.out.println( greeting );
      }
    }
    ```

    The above is a naïve example use of the `Preconditions` class.

1. Build the project

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew clean build
    ```

1. Run the project

    ```bash
    $ java -jar build/libs/demo.jar
    ```

    Note that this time the application will not run and will produce a `NoClassDefFoundError` error as shown next.

    ```bash
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/common/base/Preconditions
        at demo.App.main(App.java:11)
    Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.google.common.base.Preconditions
        at java.base/jdk.internal.loader.BuiltinClassLoader.loadClass(BuiltinClassLoader.java:602)
        at java.base/jdk.internal.loader.ClassLoaders$AppClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoaders.java:178)
        at java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:522)
        ... 1 more
    ```

Our program is making use of a class that is not part of the Java standard library and it is not part of our code.  Java has no way to locate this class and use it in our program.  Not that our JAR file only contains two files.  The `Preconditions` class is not part of our JAR file.

### The Classpath

Java searches for classes that are on the [classpath](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/findingclasses.html).  When using the `-jar` option, all classes within that JAR file are automatically included as part of the classpath.

Instead of using the `-jar` option, we can use the `-cp` to set the claspath, similar to what is shown below

```
$ java -cp path/to/lib-a.jar:path/to/lib-b.jar path.to.mainclass
```

One or more JAR files can be included in a classpath separated by a colon (`:`) on a Mac or semicolon (`;`) on a Windows OS.  We need to include two JAR files for our application to run.

1. Our application JAR file, found at

    ```bash
    ./build/libs/demo.jar
    ```

    The above JAR is built and produced by Gradle

1. The Guava JAR file.

    Gradle downloaded this library at

    ```bash
    /Users/albertattard/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/com.google.guava/guava/28.2-jre/8ec9ed76528425762174f0011ce8f74ad845b756/guava-28.2-jre.jar
    ```

    You can locate the Guava library, used by our application, using the following command

    ```bash
    $ find -L ~/.gradle/caches -name "guava-28.2-jre.jar"
    ```

    Note that if you have not yet built the application Gradle may have not yet downloaded the Guava library into the local cache.

1. Run the application using the `-cp` option

    ```bash
    $ java -cp ./build/libs/demo.jar:/Users/albertattard/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/com.google.guava/guava/28.2-jre/8ec9ed76528425762174f0011ce8f74ad845b756/guava-28.2-jre.jar demo.App
    ```

    **The above command needs to be updated according to the location where your Guava library is found**.

    The application should now be able to run and output

    ```bash
    Hello world.
    ```

This is quite inconvenient as together with our application we need to also include the libraries this application needs.  In this case, we only needed one library, but a typical program makes use many libraries.  Together with the libraries our program uses, we also need to include the transitive libraries (libraries used by the libraries we are using and so on and so forth).

This can be a nightmare for large project as Java will only fail at runtime, when that particular library is required.  A missing library can go unnoticed for some time, until the functionality that requires it is executed at runtime.

Running the application is not as simple as before, when we used the `-jar` option.  A better way is to make use of a fat JAR where all classes are packaged in one fat JAR.

### Make a fat JAR

There are several ways how to create a fat JAR

1. Update the `jar` task

    ```groovy
    jar {
      manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': application.mainClassName
      }
      from {
        configurations.runtimeClasspath.collect {
          it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it)
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Build the project and unzip it

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew clean build
    $ rm -rf temp
    $ unzip build/libs/demo.jar -d temp
    ```

    Notice that this time much more many files are included

    ```bash
    Archive:  build/libs/demo.jar
       creating: temp/META-INF/
      inflating: temp/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
       creating: temp/demo/
      inflating: temp/demo/App.class
       creating: temp/META-INF/maven/
       creating: temp/META-INF/maven/com.google.guava/
    ...
      inflating: temp/com/google/j2objc/annotations/RetainedWith.class
      inflating: temp/com/google/j2objc/annotations/Weak.class
      inflating: temp/com/google/j2objc/annotations/WeakOuter.class
    ```

    The JAR file now contains runtime dependencies (dependencies with scope `implementation`).  Note that no JUnit related classes are included as this dependency has a test scope (`testImplementation`).

1. Create custom task

    ```groovy
    task fatJar(type: Jar) {
      group = 'Distribution'
      description = 'Create an executable fat JAR'
      archiveBaseName = 'fat-jar'
      manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': application.mainClassName
      }
      from {
        configurations.runtimeClasspath.collect {
          it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it)
        }
      }
      with jar
    }
    ```

    List the available Gradle tasks (some tasks may not be visible but still be available).

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew tasks
    ```

    Note that `fatJar` task under the `Distribution tasks` section.

    ```bash
    ...

    Distribution tasks
    ------------------
    assembleDist - Assembles the main distributions
    distTar - Bundles the project as a distribution.
    distZip - Bundles the project as a distribution.
    fatJar - Create an executable fat JAR
    installDist - Installs the project as a distribution as-is.

    ...
    ```

    Create the fat JAR using the custom task

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew fatJar
    ```

    The JAR file: `build/libs/fat-jar.jar` will be created containing the application together with its runtime dependencies.

    Run the application.

    ```bash
    $ java -jar build/libs/fat-jar.jar
    Hello world.
    ```

   For more information about Gradle tasks, please refer to the [tasks user guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html).

1. Use a plugin

    **This is the preferred approach as we are reusing an existing Gradle plugin rather than adding a new Gradle task ourselves**.

    The [shadowJar](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.johnrengelman.shadow) plugin is a very popular plugin.

    Add the `shadowJar` plugin (do no remove the other plugins)

    ```groovy
    plugins {
        id 'com.github.johnrengelman.shadow' version '5.2.0'
    }
    ```

    List the available tasks

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew tasks
    ```

    `shadowJar` is one of the newly available tasks

    ```bash
    ...

    Shadow tasks
    ------------
    knows - Do you know who knows?
    shadowJar - Create a combined JAR of project and runtime dependencies

    ...
    ```

    Create the fat JAR using the `shadowJar` task

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew shadowJar
    ```

    JAR file will be created

    ```bash
    $ ls -l build/libs
    -rw-r--r-- demo-all.jar
    ```

    The `shadowJar` task is also triggered with the `build` task.

     ```bash
    $ ./gradlew clean build
     ```

     In this case two JAR files will be produced

    ```bash
    $ ls -l build/libs
    -rw-r--r-- demo-all.jar
    -rw-r--r-- demo.jar
    ```

    The `demo.jar` file does not include dependencies, while the `demo-all.jar` file does.

    Run the application.

    ```bash
    $ java -jar build/libs/demo-all.jar
    Hello world.
    ```

Irrespective from which approach we use, running the application as a fat JAR is simpler than running the application using the `-cp` option.  It also makes it simpler to distribute as all we need to share is one JAR file.

## Making Applications Portable (Containerisation using Docker)

### What is Docker?

Say that we write an application with [OpenJDK 14](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/14/) and we would like to deploy this application on a server somewhere within the organisation.  The OS where our application will be running needs to have OpenJDK 14 installed otherwise our application will not run.

Another team builds another application, this time using [NodeJS 12](https://nodejs.org/en/).  The OS where this application will be running needs to have the right version of NodeJS installed.

This raises the following questions

1. Who will be managing this?
1. Who will make sure that the correct version of libraries/frameworks platforms are installed?
1. How can we manage multiple version of libraries/frameworks/platforms running at the same time?
1. How can we ensure that the application works as expected on the production environment?
1. How will we save the configuration such that we can scale it to hundreds or thousands of servers?

Gradle helps us building and packaging all application's dependencies into one fat JAR, but it falls short in setting up the operating system.  That's outside its scope.

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is a tool that we can use to bridge this gap and have an environment ready for our application to run on.

### How does this work?

In a nutshell, an application is packaged into a [Docker Image](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-objects).  For example, if OpenJDK 14 is needed to run the application, we set up Docker image to have OpenJDK 14 installed.  If another application requires Oracle JRE 8, we setup a separate Docker image for the second application.

Similar to Java JAR files, docker creates images, which are the unit of work for docker.  A docker image can be started using a command similar to the following.

```bash
$ docker run my-app
```

Docker takes the image named `my-app` and runs it as a docker container.  **Note that here we switched from docker image to docker container**.

**An instance of a docker image is called a docker container**.

A docker container is a running version of the docker image.  If the application produces logs files, these logs files will be in the docker container (not in the docker image).

A docker container can start and stop like any OS.  The state of a docker container may or may not be preserved between different runs.  With that said, **do not rely on the container state in production**.  [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) can be used to address this issue, but this goes way beyond the scope of this literature.

### More than just Containers

Docker provides more than just the correct configuration.

1. **Limited Access**

    Consider the case where two or more applications are running on the same OS.  One of the applications may be able (intentionally or unintentionally) be able to access files saved by another application running on the same OS.

    Someone needs to make sure that an application does not access resources that belong to another application.

    Secrets used to access resources, such as databases, may be saved as environment variables.  OS scope environment variables are available to all applications running on the same OS.  Any application running on the same OS will be able to access the secrets that belong to another application.

1. **Limit attack surface area**

    Say that we have a server with several applications running on it and one of these applications have a security vulnerability.

    Vulnerabilities may come from different places including libraries used by an application or the platform on which it runs.

    The other applications running on the same OS may be affected by this vulnerability too.

1. **Limit Damage**

    An application may misbehave such that it causes the OS to misbehave, perform poorly or crash

    1. Consume more memory than planned
    1. Open too many files handles
    1. Open too many threads

    It is not always easy to configure the OS such that it limits the resources each application uses.

### Setup Docker

1. Verify that docker is installed

    ```bash
    $ docker --version
    Docker version 19.03.8, build afacb8b
    ```

    Install docker if missing following the instructions: [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

1. Verify that docker is running

    ![Docker Desktop](assets/images/Docker%20Desktop%20Tray%20Icon.png)

### Working with Docker

1. A docker hub account is required.  [Create an account](https://hub.docker.com/signup/) if you do not have one yet.

1. Work with an existing docker image (created by someone else)

    This [docker image `bash:5.0.17`](https://hub.docker.com/_/bash) is a basic Linux OS that has `bash` support.

    ```bash
    $ docker pull bash:5.0.17
    ```

    Alternative, we can run the image immediately using `run` instead of `pull`.

    You need to be logged in, otherwise you will get an error similar to the following.

    ```bash
    Error response from daemon: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/library/bash/manifests/5.0.17: unauthorized: incorrect username or password
    ```

    Login

    ```bash
    $ docker login --username <YOUR-USERNAME>
    Login Succeeded
    ```

1. Run the docker image

    ```bash
    $ docker run -it bash:5.0.17
    ```

    Now you are in the `bash:5.0.17` docker container

    ```bash
    bash-5.0#
    ```

    The [`-i` option](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#foreground) indicates that we need to interact with the docker container.  Without it, we will not be able to interact with the docker container.  This is very useful while debugging.

1. Open another terminal and run

    ```bash
    $ docker ps
    ```

    This will show the running docker containers

    ```bash
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
    110810b3d472        bash:5.0.17         "docker-entrypoint.s…"   53 minutes ago      Up 53 minutes                           brave_payne
    ```

    Some of the information, such as the `CONTAINER ID` and the `NAMES`, will be different.  Note that rerunning the image will create a new container which will have different and independent state from any other containers, even containers for the same image.

1. Try out some commands

    1. `pwd`

        ```bash
        bash-5.0# pwd
        /
        ```

    1. `ls -la`

        ```bash
        bash-5.0# ls -la
        total 64
        drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 May  5 09:54 .

        drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root          4096 Apr 24 22:51 var
        ```

    1. `echo`

        ```bash
        bash-5.0# echo "Hello Docker"
        Hello Docker
        ```

    1. `env`

        ```bash
        bash-5.0# env
        HOSTNAME=110810b3d472
        PWD=/
        _BASH_GPG_KEY=7C0135FB088AAF6C66C650B9BB5869F064EA74AB
        HOME=/root
        _BASH_VERSION=5.0
        _BASH_PATCH_LEVEL=0
        _BASH_LATEST_PATCH=17
        TERM=xterm
        SHLVL=1
        PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
        _=/usr/bin/env
        ```

1. Add [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)

    `curl` is not available on the image we are using.  We can use a different image that already contains `curl`, or install it ourselves.

    **⚠️ Note that we are working inside a container and all changes we make to this container will be lost once this container is stopped.**

    ```bash
    bash-5.0# curl http://www.google.com
    bash: curl: command not found
    ```

    Use the package manager available to the OS you are using.  Alpine, the OS we are using, uses the [`apk` package manager](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management).  A list of available packages is available [here](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages).

    ```bash
    bash-5.0# apk add curl
    fetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.11/main/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz
    fetch http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.11/community/x86_64/APKINDEX.tar.gz
    (1/4) Installing ca-certificates (20191127-r1)
    (2/4) Installing nghttp2-libs (1.40.0-r0)
    (3/4) Installing libcurl (7.67.0-r0)
    (4/4) Installing curl (7.67.0-r0)
    Executing busybox-1.31.1-r9.trigger
    Executing ca-certificates-20191127-r1.trigger
    OK: 8 MiB in 21 packages
    ```

    Now we have `curl` installed

    ```bash
    bash-5.0# curl http://www.google.com
    <!doctype html><html itemscope="" ...
    ```

    Note that `curl` is not part of the image.  Only this container has `curl` installed.  The `curl` will not be available on any other container for the same image.

    1. Stop the container

        ```bash
        bash-5.0# exit
        $ exit
        ```

    1. Start a new container

        ```bash
        $ docker run -it bash:5.0.17
        bash-5.0#
        ```

    1. Try the `curl` command

        ```bash
        bash-5.0# curl http://www.google.com
        bash: curl: command not found
        ```

    **Any changes made to a container are lost once the container is stopped**.

1. How can we run a Java application within a container?

    The `bash:5.0.17` image does not include Java.

    ```bash
    $ docker run -it bash:5.0.17
    bash-5.0# java -version
    bash: java: command not found
    ```

    We can use an image which have the Java we need already installed, such as the [`adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/adoptopenjdk/openjdk14).

    ```bash
    $ docker run -it adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine
    ```

    Note that some examples may also append the command to be executed when the container starts, such as

    ```bash
    $ docker run -it adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine /bin/sh
    ```

    The above is instructing docker to open a shell terminal.  Note that the image `adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine` does not have `bash` installed.  We can use the `sh` instead.  That is why we are running the `/bin/sh` command instead of `/bin/bash`.

    Check the Java version installed

    ```bash
    # java -version
    openjdk version "14.0.1" 2020-04-14
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 14.0.1+7)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 14.0.1+7, mixed mode, sharing)
    ```

    This docker image comes with Java 14 already setup.  A more important observation is that given that we are using a specific version of the image, we will always have the same version of Java installed.

    How do we get our application in the docker container?  The application needs to be dockerize, [described in the Dockerize the Application section](#dockerize-the-application).

### Dockerize the Application

1. The `Dockerfile` text file

    Docker will use a text file named `Dockerfile` to create our image.  The `Dockerfile` file is part of the source code and can be used by the build pipeline to build our docker images and deploy them into production environments.

    **Steps**:

    1. Create the `Dockerfile`

        ```bash
        $ vi Dockerfile
        ```

1. Extend an existing docker image

    We can create a docker image from scratch, but this will require lots of effort as we need to install the OS files, the packages we need (such as `curl` for example) and install the correct version of Java.  Alternatively, we can use an existing image from the docker repository that does this for us.

    **⚠️ Note that many companies, have internal docker repositories and only allow images coming from these repositories for security purposes**.  Such docker repositories scan the images and make sure that these docker images are secure and do not contain any funny business.

    ```dockerfile
    FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine
    ```

    The above docker file is extending one of the [adoptopenjdk](https://hub.docker.com/r/adoptopenjdk/openjdk14) images as defined by the [`FROM` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from).

    Fragments of the docker image [adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-docker/blob/master/14/jre/alpine/Dockerfile.hotspot.releases.full) are shown next.

    ```dockerfile
    FROM alpine:3.11

    ENV LANG='en_US.UTF-8' LANGUAGE='en_US:en' LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'

    RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps curl binutils \
        && GLIBC_VER="2.31-r0" \
        && ALPINE_GLIBC_REPO="https://github.com/sgerrand/alpine-pkg-glibc/releases/download" \
        && GCC_LIBS_URL="https://archive.archlinux.org/packages/g/gcc-libs/gcc-libs-9.1.0-2-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz" \
        && GCC_LIBS_SHA256="91dba90f3c20d32fcf7f1dbe91523653018aa0b8d2230b00f822f6722804cf08" \

    ...

    ENV JAVA_HOME=/opt/java/openjdk \
        PATH="/opt/java/openjdk/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    Please note that the above is incomplete for brevity and the full example can be found [here]( https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-docker/blob/master/14/jre/alpine/Dockerfile.hotspot.releases.full).

    The `adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine` installs the [Adopt OpenJDK 14](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html) and set the environment.  The `adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine` docker image is built on top of another image, the [alpine:3.11](https://github.com/alpinelinux/docker-alpine/blob/c5510d5b1d2546d133f7b0938690c3c1e2cd9549/x86_64/Dockerfile), shown next.

    ```dockerfile
    FROM scratch
    ADD alpine-minirootfs-3.11.6-x86_64.tar.gz /
    CMD ["/bin/sh"]
    ```

    The `alpine:3.11` does not depend on anything (as indicated by the [`FROM scratch` instruction]( https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/baseimages/)) and is referred to as base image.

    If we want to create a docker image from scratch, we need to merge both docker images, and the files they are referring to, into our docker file.  Note that this is necessary in our case, and will simply extend an existing image.

    **Steps**:

    1. Import from `adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine` in the `Dockerfile`

        ```dockerfile
        FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine
        ```

    1. Build the new docker image

        ```bash
        $ docker build . -t demo:local
        Sending build context to Docker daemon  166.9kB
        Step 1/1 : FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine
         ---> 82f70d1be68e
        Successfully built 82f70d1be68e
        Successfully tagged demo:local
        ```

    1. Run the newly built docker image

        ```bash
        $ docker run -it demo:local /bin/sh
        #
        ```

    1. Verify the Java version

        ```bash
        # java -version
        openjdk version "14.0.1" 2020-04-14
        OpenJDK Runtime Environment AdoptOpenJDK (build 14.0.1+7)
        OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM AdoptOpenJDK (build 14.0.1+7, mixed mode, sharing)
        ```

    1. Check the working directory

        ```bash
        # pwd
        /
        ```

1. Set the working directory

    ```dockerfile
    WORKDIR /opt/app
    ```

    The [`WORKDIR` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir) defines directory where our application will be running from.

    Why do we need to change the working directory?

    1. Putting our application in a specific directory helps us organise our application better.  In some cases, we have more than one file.  For example, a web application may contain several files and other web assets.  Having such application in the root directory is a bit messy.  Furthermore, the application itself may expose some files found on the OS and return these to the caller.  We do not want to return a sensitive file by mistake, just because we deployed our application in the root folder.

    1. Putting our application in a specific directory allows us to limit the access rights for the users that will be used to run our application to just this directory.  This will prevent an attacker, accessing anywhere else in the docker container by simply taking advantage of a vulnerability within our application.

    The working directory of our docker image is `/` (the root folder).  We will change this it to `/opt/app`.  The directory does not need to exist and will be created automatically.

    **Steps**:

    1. Add the working directory to the `Dockerfile`

        ```dockerfile
        WORKDIR /opt/app
        ```

    1. Build the new docker image

        ```bash
        $ docker build . -t demo:local
        Sending build context to Docker daemon  166.9kB
        Step 1/2 : FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine
         ---> 82f70d1be68e
        Step 2/2 : WORKDIR /opt/app
         ---> Using cache
         ---> e5738c7ba12f
        Successfully built e5738c7ba12f
        Successfully tagged demo:local
        ```

    Note that now we have two steps, one for every line in the `Dockerfile`

    1. Run the image and print the current working directory

        ```bash
        $ docker run -it demo:local /bin/sh
        # pwd
        /opt/app
        ```

1. Copy our application to docker

    We need to copy our JAR file from the local filesystem to the docker image using the [`COPY` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy).

    ```dockerfile
    COPY ./build/libs/demo-all.jar ./application.jar
    ```

    When docker builds the image, it will copy the file `./build/libs/demo-all.jar` to the docker image being created.  Here we are also renaming the JAR file to `application.jar`.

    **Steps**:

    1. Built the project

        ```bash
        ./gradlew clean build
        ```

        The JAR file produced by the build task will be used to create the docker image.  The docker image relies on the fat JAR file

        ```
        build/libs/demo-all.jar
        ```

        This needs to be an executable (fat) JAR containing all dependencies.  The JAR file needs to be able to run using just

        ```bash
        $ java -jar build/libs/demo.jar
        ```

        This is how docker will run our application

    1. Add the `COPY` instruction to the `Dockerfile`

        ```dockerfile
        COPY ./build/libs/demo-all.jar ./application.jar
        ```

    1. Build the new docker image

        ```bash
        $ docker build . -t demo:local
        Sending build context to Docker daemon  14.77MB
        Step 1/3 : FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine
         ---> 82f70d1be68e
        Step 2/3 : WORKDIR /opt/app
         ---> Using cache
         ---> e5738c7ba12f
        Step 3/3 : COPY ./build/libs/demo-all.jar ./application.jar
         ---> b5ff637e4e91
        Successfully built b5ff637e4e91
        Successfully tagged demo:local
        ```

        Note that now we have three steps, one for every instruction we have in the `Dockefile`.

    1. Manually run the application

        Run the newly built docker image and list the files in the current directory.

        ```bash
        $ docker run -it demo:local /bin/sh
        # pwd
        /opt/app
        # ls -l
        -rw-r--r-- application.jar
        ```

        Run the application using the same `java -jar` command passing `application.jar` as the JAR file

        ```bash
        # java -jar application.jar
        Hello world.
        ```

    Note that our application was copied into docker, but we have to manually start it.

1. Make the application to run on start-up

    ```dockerfile
    CMD ["java", "-jar", "application.jar"]
    ```

    The [`CMD` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) instructs docker container to run the given command when the container starts.

    **Steps**:

    1. Add the `CMD` instruction to the `Dockerfile`

        ```dockerfile
        CMD ["java", "-jar", "application.jar"]
        ```

    1. Build the new docker image

        ```bash
        $ docker build . -t demo:local
        Sending build context to Docker daemon  14.77MB
        Step 1/4 : FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine
         ---> 82f70d1be68e
        Step 2/4 : WORKDIR /opt/app
         ---> Using cache
         ---> e5738c7ba12f
        Step 3/4 : COPY ./build/libs/demo-all.jar ./application.jar
         ---> Using cache
         ---> b5ff637e4e91
        Step 4/4 : CMD ["java", "-jar", "application.jar"]
         ---> Running in cd66c5b54493
        Removing intermediate container cd66c5b54493
         ---> efab5e9092f4
        Successfully built efab5e9092f4
        Successfully tagged demo:local
        ```

        Note that now we have four steps, one for every instruction we have in the `Dockefile`.

    1. Run the docker image

        ```bash
        $ docker run -t demo:local
        Hello world.
        ```

        Note that we are not using the `-i` flag anymore.  Docker knows what needs to be done and we do not need to interact with it unless we need to debug something.  This is how docker will actually run our container.

The complete `Dockerfile` is shown next

```dockerfile
FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine
WORKDIR /opt/app
COPY ./build/libs/demo.jar ./application.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "application.jar"]
```

### Multi-Stage Docker Build

The docker file depends on the JAR file to be generated before it runs.  Docker can be used to first build the executable JAR and then creates the image.

For docker to be able to build the application it now needs the source code and any other artefacts required to run `./gradlew build`.  We can copy all files, but that's considered as bad practice as ideally docker build a clean image and should not reuse anything else but the source files from our local filesystem.  **Docker should be able to build the image by simply checking out the source from the repository and the execute `docker build`**.

We have two options to selectively copy the files required by the `./gradlew build` to successfully run.

1. Create [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file) file

    ```
    .classpath
    .dockerignore
    .git
    .gitattributes
    .gitignore
    .gradle
    .idea
    .project
    .settings
    .vscode
    Dockerfile
    bin
    build
    gradlew.bat
    out
    ```

    The `COPY` command will ignore all matching files.

    Alternatively to adding a `.dockerignore`, add multiple `COPY` commands to the `Dockerfile`

    ```dockerfile
    COPY ./build.gradle .
    COPY ./gradle ./gradle
    COPY ./gradlew .
    COPY ./settings.gradle .
    COPY ./src ./src
    ```

    I personally prefer this option as I intentionally include the file and folders I need to copy.  If the IDE generates new files, these are not automatically copied as I forgot to include them to the `.dockerignore`.

1. Clean the project

    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew clean
    ```

    This is not required, but I prefer to remove any artefacts from the local filesystem to iron out any chances that built artefacts are copied by mistake.

1. Update the `dockerfile` making it a multi-stage docker file

    Example using `.dockerignore`

    ```dockerfile
    FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jdk-14.0.1_7-alpine-slim AS builder
    WORKDIR /opt/app
    COPY . .
    RUN ./gradlew build

    FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine
    WORKDIR /opt/app
    COPY --from=builder /opt/app/build/libs/demo.jar ./application.jar
    CMD ["java", "-jar", "application.jar"]
    ```

    Alternatively, copy individual files and folders (preferred option).

    ```dockerfile
    FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jdk-14.0.1_7-alpine-slim AS builder
    WORKDIR /opt/app
    COPY ./build.gradle .
    COPY ./gradle ./gradle
    COPY ./gradlew .
    COPY ./settings.gradle .
    COPY ./src ./src
    RUN ./gradlew build

    FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk14:jre-14.0.1_7-alpine
    WORKDIR /opt/app
    COPY --from=builder /opt/app/build/libs/demo.jar ./application.jar
    CMD ["java", "-jar", "application.jar"]
    ```

    The [`RUN` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run) can be used to run command, such as install packages that we need (like `curl`) or build the project as we did here.

    We do not need to include the `clean` Gradle task here as we only copied the sources without any built artefacts.  Therefore, there is nothing to clean as the `build` directory was not copied.

    This time docker will build the JAR and then package it.  Unfortunately, it does not take advantage of any caching and makes it a bit slower.  **While this is slow for development purposes, it ensures that the build is not relying on caches.**

1. Run the docker image

    ```bash
    $ docker run -it demo:local
    Hello world.
    ```

For more details, please refer to: [https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/).

Multi-stage docker images are not very common as this feature is not supported by some providers.  Furthermore, the functionality provided by the Multi-stage docker built is also provided by the Pipeline tools such as [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) and [GoCD](https://www.gocd.org/) and developers/dev-ops prefer to use this as they tend to provide more than just build the project.

### Managing Docker Containers

Once an application is built and packaged into a container, this needs to be executed.  We ran our application by using the `run` command

```bash
$ docker run -it demo:local
```

That's all great for development.

Consider the following:

1. What happens if our application becomes unresponsive or crashes?
1. What happens if our application experiences more load and new instances need to be started?
1. How will we reduce the number of instances running when our application is not being used?
1. How will we deploy new versions of our application?
1. Can we have red/green deployments?
1. How will we monitor our application?
1. How can we access the logs of our application?

There are many more things to consider when running an application irrespective from docker.  Docker enables developers to take advantage of tools that can help us with the above concerns and more as discussed before (such as security).  Following are **some** (not complete) tools and services we can use to manage our docker containers in a production environment.

1. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
1. [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)
1. [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)
1. [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
1. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
1. [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)
1. [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/)
1. [Rancher](https://rancher.com/)

Some of the above services are able work with JAR files directly and we do not need to create a docker container.  For example, using [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)  we can deploy the JAR file and have AWS handling the rest.
